1. It is used when the solution can be recursively described in terms of solutions to subproblems
(optimal substructure).
2. Algorithm finds solutions to subproblems and stores them in memory for later use.
3. It is more efficient than “brute-force methods”, which solve the same subproblems over and over again.
4. Mainly provides optimal solution
5. Dynamic Programming works on Principle of Optimality
