1. The All-Pairs Shortest Path problem aims to find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a 
weighted graph - directed or undirected.
2. This means computing the shortest path from every node to every other node.
3. Floyd–Warshall Algorithm (Dynamic Programming)
4. formula - dist[i][j] = min( dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] )
