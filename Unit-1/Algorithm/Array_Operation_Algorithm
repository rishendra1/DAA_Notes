The algorithm that adds two arrays A and B in element wise,
1. i := 1          -->  1
2. if i > n goto 9 -->  n + 1
3. X := A[i]       -->  n
4. Y := B[i]       -->  n
5. Z := X + Y      -->  n
6. C[i] := Z       -->  n
7. i = i + 1       -->  n
8. goto 2          -->  n
9. end  //total is --> 7n + 2

for loop :-
 General form for no. of statements during a for loop is,
        " 2 + n(b + 3) "
