Time Complexity:-
  1. Counts no. of Operations
  2. Time Required by Algorithm to execute
Big O - Notation:-
Examples:-
  1. O(1) - Push, pop, Enqueue, Dequeue
  2. O(log(n)) - Binary Search
  3. O(n) - Linear Search
  4. O(n.log(n)) - Quick Sort, Merge Sort
  5. O(n*n) - Bubble, Insertion, Selection Sorts
  6. O(n*n*n) - Matrix Multiplication
Space Complexity:-
  Amount of memory that an Algorithm needs to run
