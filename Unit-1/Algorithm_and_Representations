Algorithm :- An algorithm is a finite, step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem or completing a task, converting input data into a desired output. It's a 
              procedure that defines what to do and how to do it, functioning like a recipe for a computer or a manual for a person.
Representation of Algorithm :-
1. Step - by - Step instruction
2. Flow chart
3. Pseudocode
4. UML,FSL Diagram
Flow chart :-
a.) oval - start, end
b.) Paralellogram - Inputs , Outputs
c.) Rectangle - Operations
d.) Rhombus - Conditions
