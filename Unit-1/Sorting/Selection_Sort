Selection Sort Algorithm :-

1. In selection sort, we find minimum, second minimum, third minimum and so on and arrange
them in increasing order.
2. Like bubble sort, irrespective of the input, during ith stage this algorithm incurs (n âˆ’ i)
comparisons.
3. Time complexity - O(n*n)

Algorithm :

1. Algorithm Selection_Sort(A,n)
2. {
3.   for j = 1 to n - 1 do,
4.       min := j
5.       for i = j + 1 to n do,
6.           if a[i] < a[min] ,
7.               min = i 
8.        swap(a[j],a[min])
9. end
10.}
