Masters Theorm :-

1. Masters theorm is used to find time complexities of a given program or block of code.
2. There are two different cases in Master Theorm :
            a.) Decreasing Functions
            b.) Dividing Functions
Now, we are going to discuss about the Masters theorm for decreasing functions
i.) General form for decreasing functions is,
        T(n) = a. T(n - b) + f(n)
        where, 'a' and 'b' are constants
        where 'f(n)' is the work done outside the function call
there are three cases here,
  a. if a < 1, then T(n) = O(n^k)
  b. if a = 1, then T(n) = O(n*n^(k))
  c. if a > 1, then T(n) = O(a^(n/b) * n^k)
