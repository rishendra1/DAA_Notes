1. Algorithm Factorial(n)
2. // 'n' is the number that we need to find the factorial
3. {
4. if n = 0 then,  return 1;
5. else if n = 1 then,  return 1;
6. else if n > 1 then, return (n * Factorial(n - 1));
7. }

For example, we need to find the factorial of "5"
fact(5)
= 5 * fact(4)
= 5 * (4 * fact(3))
= 5 * (4 * (3 * fact(2)))
= 5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * fact(1))))
= 5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * 1)))
= 5 * (4 * (3 * 2))
= 5 * (4 * 6)
= 5 * 24
= 120
